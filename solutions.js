// Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.

// By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.

// E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.

// If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.

// The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!

// If you like this Kata, maybe try this one next: https://www.codewars.com/kata/represent-array-of-numbers-as-ranges

// 1 Can you write a solution that will return null2 for both [] and [ x ] though? (This is an empty array and one with a single number and is not tested for, but you can write your own example test. )

// 2
// Swift, Ruby and Crystal: nil
// Haskell: Nothing
// Python, Rust, Scala: None
// Julia: nothing
// Nim: none(int)

function firstNonConsecutive (arr) {
  for (let i = 0; i< arr.length - 1; i++)
      if (arr[i+1] - arr[i] !== 1) {
          return arr[i+1]
      }
  return null
}

// In this simple exercise, you will build a program that takes a value, integer , and returns a list of its multiples up to another value, limit . If limit is a multiple of integer, it should be included as well. There will only ever be positive integers passed into the function, not consisting of 0. The limit will always be higher than the base.

// For example, if the parameters passed are (2, 6), the function should return [2, 4, 6] as 2, 4, and 6 are the multiples of 2 up to 6.

// If you can, try writing it in only one line of code.

function findMultiples(integer, limit) {
  //your code here
    let answer = []
    let i = 1
    while (i * integer <= limit){
        answer.push(i * integer)
        i ++
    }
    return answer
}




// If you've completed this kata already and want a bigger challenge, here's the 3D version

// Bob is bored during his physics lessons so he's built himself a toy box to help pass the time. The box is special because it has the ability to change gravity.

// There are some columns of toy cubes in the box arranged in a line. The i-th column contains a_i cubes. At first, the gravity in the box is pulling the cubes downwards. When Bob switches the gravity, it begins to pull all the cubes to a certain side of the box, d, which can be either 'L' or 'R' (left or right). Below is an example of what a box of cubes might look like before and after switching gravity.

// +---+                                       +---+
// |   |                                       |   |
// +---+                                       +---+
// +---++---+     +---+              +---++---++---+
// |   ||   |     |   |   -->        |   ||   ||   |
// +---++---+     +---+              +---++---++---+
// +---++---++---++---+         +---++---++---++---+
// |   ||   ||   ||   |         |   ||   ||   ||   |
// +---++---++---++---+         +---++---++---++---+
// Given the initial configuration of the cubes in the box, find out how many cubes are in each of the n columns after Bob switches the gravity.

// Examples (input -> output:
// * 'R', [3, 2, 1, 2]      ->  [1, 2, 2, 3]
// * 'L', [1, 4, 5, 3, 5 ]  ->  [5, 5, 4, 3, 1]

const flip=(d, c)=>{
  if (d.toLowerCase() === 'r'){
    c = c.sort(function (a, b) { return a - b; })
  }else if (d.toLowerCase() === 'l'){
    c = c.sort(function (a, b) {  return b - a; })
  } return c
